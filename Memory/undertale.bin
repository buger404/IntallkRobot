I wonder... What happens when something without a SOUL gains the will to live?
RUN. INTO. THE. BULLETS!!!
Die.
you have anything better to do.
If you let me live... I'll come back. I'll kill you. I'll kill everyone. I'll kill everyone you love.
Well. You DID do what I told you. I guess it's up to me to get you a REAL happy ending.
Each one could have been someone else's Toriel. Selfish brat. Somebody is dead because of you.
Is this a joke? Are you Braindead?
In this world... It's KILL or BE killed!
Remember... THIS time, you've GOT to become friends with everyone. OK? If you DON'T, you'll be miserable FOREVER.
I just can't understand... I can't understand! I can't understand. ...why are you being... ...so nice to me?
Hee hee hee. Don't worry. I know there's no REAL point in fighting you. The human souls would probably just revolt again.
Say. What if I told you... I knew some way to get you a better ending?
've been thinking. Is killing things really necessary? ... Prove to me you are strong enough to survive. Get here from the beginning. Without killing a single thing... ...and I won't kill the king. ...and, maybe... Then you'll have your so-called 'happy ending.
So you went the whole way through without killing... And then you decided to kill ASGORE? What the hell is WRONG with you? You COMPLETELY missed the point. Are you trolling me? Because. No. You are only trolling yourself. What a waste of everybody's time.
Are you friends with all of them yet? Maybe you should go back and... "hang" with them. The power of friendship... That always saves the day, right?
I knew you had it in you!
So, even with everything you did... The outcome's still the same. In the end, your choices were an illusion. NOTHING you do really matters! Hee hee hee!
We were on our way to REAL victory... Why'd you have to SCREW IT UP?
Well, I'll let you mess around. I know you'll come back eventually. And when that time comes... I'll be waiting for you.
#toriel
You read the passage... 'Why did the skeleton want a friend?' 'Because she was feeling BONELY...
I've also prepared a curriculum for your education. This may come as a surprise to you... But I have always wanted to be a teacher. ...actually, perhaps that isn't very surprising.
You naive child... If you leave the RUINS... They... ASGORE... Will kill you. I am only protecting you, do you understand?
If you truly wish to leave the RUINS... I will not stop you. However, when you leave... Please do not come back. I hope you understand.
You came from this world, right...? So you must have a place to return to, do you not? What will you do now?
Frisk... You really are a funny child. If you had said that earlier, none of this would have happened. It is a good thing you took so long to change your mind.
Well... I suppose. If you really do not have any other place to go... I will do my best to take care of you, for as long as you need.
...I see. Well, I hope that I am not keeping you. 'See you around.'
ou are stronger than I thought... Listen to me, small one... If you go beyond this door, Keep walking as far as you can. Eventually you will reach an exit. ....... ASGORE... Do not let ASGORE take your soul. His plan cannot be allowed to succeed. ...... Be good, won't you? My child.
You... ...at my most vulnerable moment... To think I was worried you wouldn't fit in out there... Eheheheh!!! You really are no different than them!
Y... you... really hate me that much? Now I see who I was protecting by keeping you here. Not you... But them!
I do not know if this is pathetic, or endearing.
Sans, did I tell you about the time Frisk flirted with me...? And then asked to call me "mother?"
When humans fall down here, strangely... I... I often feel like I already know them. Truthfully, when I first saw you, I felt... ... like I was seeing an old friend for the first time.
Psssst. Gorey, wake up.
You pathetic whelp. If you really wanted to free our kind... You could have gone through the barrier after you got ONE SOUL...
As terrible as ASGORE is... He deserves mercy, too.
What a miserable creature, torturing such a poor, innocent, youth...
Who the hell is Sans? Who the HECK is Sans?
#sans
The end of your journey is at hand.
In a few moments, you will meet the king.
You will determine the future of this world.
if you keep going the way you are now... you're gonna have a bad time.
take care of yourself, kid. 'cause someone really cares about you.
You dirty brother killer.
you can't understand how this feels. knowing that one day, without any warning... it's all going to be reset. look. i gave up trying to go back a long time ago. and getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore, either. 'cause even if we do... we'll just end up right back here, without any memory of it, right? to be blunt... it makes it kind of hard to give it my all. ... or is that just a poor excuse for being lazy...? hell if i know.
i asked her what was up. then she told me something strange. 'if a human ever comes through this door... ...could you please, please promise something? watch over them, and protect them, will you not? now, i hate making promises. and this woman, i don't even know her name. but... someone who sincerely likes bad jokes... has an integrity you can't say 'no' to.
our reports showed a massive anomaly in the timespace continuum.
that look on your face while i was talking... you've already heard my spiel, haven't you? i suspected something like this. you're always acting like you know what's going to happen.
i'll be honest. i have no idea what happened for you to get here. this is actually some sort of error-handling message. so, if you're getting this ending... tell whoever made the game, okay? chances are, though... you're just a dirty hacker, aren't you? yeah, get outta here.
i'm actually supposed to be on watch for humans right now. but... y'know... i don't really care about capturing anybody. now my brother, papyrus... he's a human-hunting FANATIC.
have you ever heard of a talking flower? ... so you know all about it. the echo flower. ... what about it? well, papyrus told me something interesting the other day. sometimes, when no one else is around, a flower appears and whispers things to him. flattery... advice... encouragement... ...predictions. weird, huh?
i'll be 'frank' with you. as much as i like putting hot dogs on your head... thirty is just an excessive number. twenty-nine, now that's fine, but thirty... does it look like my arms can reach that high?
so i keep 'em coming, and she keeps laughing. she's the best audience i've ever had. ... we kept telling each other jokes for hours. eventually, i had to leave. ... but she told me to come by again, and so i did. then i did again. and again. it's a thing now. telling bad jokes through the door. it rules.
haven't i done a great job protecting you? i mean, look at yourself. you haven't died a single time. hey, what's that look supposed to mean? am i wrong...?
What's EXP? It's an acronym. It stands for 'execution points.' A way of quantifying the pain you have inflicted on others. When you kill someone, your EXP increases. When you have enough EXP, your LOVE increases. LOVE, too, is an acronym. It stands for 'Level of Violence.' A way of measuring someone's capacity to hurt. The more you kill, the easier it becomes to distance yourself. The more you distance yourself, the less you will hurt. The more easily you can bring yourself to hurt others.
You will be judged for every action. You will be judged for every EXP you earned.
your actions here... will determine the fate of the entire world. if you refuse to fight... asgore will take your soul and destroy humanity. but if you kill asgore and go home... monsters will remain trapped underground. what will you do?
but you didn't get this far by giving up, did you? that's right. you have something called 'determination.' so as long as you hold on... so long as you do what's in your heart... i believe you can do the right thing.
so... i have a request for you. i kind of have a secret codeword that only i know. so if someone tells it to me... they'll have to be a time traveler. crazy, right?
so, i guess you're qualified. here's the key to my room. it's time... you learned the truth.
truthfully, it doesn't really matter what you said. all that's important is that you were honest with yourself.
ou act like you know what's gonna happen. like you've already experienced it all before. this is an odd thing to say, but... if you have some sort of special power... isn't it your responsibility to do the right thing?
well, i'll be straight-forward with you. my brother'd really like to see a human... so, y'know, it'd really help me out... if you kept pretending to be one.
hey, i really respect what you did back there.
that expression that you're wearing... well, i won't grace it with a description.
sounds strange, but before all this i was secretly hoping we could be friends. i always thought the anomaly was doing this cause they were unhappy. and when they got what they wanted, they would stop all this. and maybe all they needed was... i dunno. some good food, some bad laughs, some nice friends.
welp. sorry, old lady. this is why i never make promises.
hey. is your refrigerator running?
he's a human-hunting FANATIC.

I WILL BE THE ONE!
I MUST BE THE ONE!
I WILL CAPTURE A HUMAN!
THAT'S RIGHT, HUMAN! YOU CAN WIN!! JUST DO WHAT I, WOULD DO... BELIEVE IN YOU!!!
-WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I EXPECTED... BUT... ST... STILL! I BELIEVE IN YOU! YOU CAN DO A LITTLE BETTER! EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK SO! I... I PROMISE...
I THOUGHT UNDYNE COULD BE FRIENDS WITH YOU. BUT I GUESS... I OVERESTIMATED HER. SHE'S JUST NOT UP TO THE CHALLENGE.
THAT BOOK'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. 'ADVANCED PUZZLE CONSTRUCTION FOR CRITICAL MINDS.' THAT NEXT BOOK'S ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES. 'PEEK-A-BOO WITH FLUFFY BUNNY.' THE ENDING ALWAYS GETS ME.
AH, YES, ACTION FIGURES. A GREAT REFERENCE FOR THEORETICAL BATTLE SCENARIOS.
OOH, IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME-SHOW! (It says 'STAY TUNED FOR A NEW PROGRAM - MTT.) WHAT!!! IT'S USUALLY BETTER THAN THIS! THIS IS JUST A BAD EPISODE!!! DON'T JUDGE ME!!!
HE'S MY FAVORITE SEXY RECTANGLE!! I WISH I LIVED IN HOTLAND!!!
LASERS ON CONVEYORS? NO THANKS. SOUNDS LIKE MY LEAST FAVORITE NIGHTMARE.
IT'S BEEN EIGHT DAYS AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T... RECALIBRATED. YOUR. PUZZLES! YOU JUST HANG AROUND OUTSIDE YOUR STATION! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?!?
NOT A ROCK...? OH NO!!! BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION!!! THAT MEANS IT'S A HUMAN!!!
 PITY YOU... LONELY HUMAN... WORRY NOT!!! YOU SHALL BE LONELY NO LONGER! I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS, WILL BE YOUR... ... NO... NO, THIS IS ALL WRONG! I CAN'T BE YOUR FRIEND!!! YOU ARE A HUMAN! I MUST CAPTURE YOU!!! THEN, I CAN FULFILL MY LIFELONG DREAM!!! POWERFUL! POPULAR! PRESTIGIOUS!!! THAT'S PAPYRUS!!! THE NEWEST MEMBER... OF THE ROYAL GUARD!
I AM CERTAIN IF YOU JUST SAY... 'EXCUSE ME, MR. DREEMURR... CAN I PLEASE GO HOME?' HE'LL GUIDE YOU RIGHT TO THE BARRIER HIMSELF!
HUMAN. IT'S CLEAR NOW. YOU'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME. EVERYTHING YOU DO. EVERYTHING YOU SAY. IT'S ALL BEEN FOR MY SAKE.
BUT UNDYNE, YOU DON'T H-HAVE TO DESTROY THEM! YOU SEE... YOU SEE... ... ... ...I UNDERSTAND. I'LL HELP YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO BETRAY EITHER OF YOU! SINCE I JUST TOLD HER WHAT YOU SAID! I REALLY CAN BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE!!!
GREAT!!! BECAUSE SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE. BEING READY EARLY! IT SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU CARE!! EVEN IF SHE'S NOT HERE TO SEE THAT.
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE CAUGHT HEAT-STROKE OR SOMETHING. SOMEONE MUST HAVE BROUGHT HER BACK HOME... BECAUSE SHE CAN BARELY MOVE.IN ANY CASE, I DON'T THINK WE CAN HANG OUT. I'M JUST WAITING HERE IN CASE SHE NEEDS ME.
HEY! READY TO HANG OUT WITH UNDYNE??? GREAT!!! ME TOO!!!
ORMALLY SHE RETURNS AT ABOUT THIS TIME. SHE'S LATE THOUGH... AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE. HOW STRANGE.
LET'S JUST SAY... A TINY FLOWER HELPED ME.
HEY! NOBODY FIGHT ANYONE! IF ANYONE FIGHTS ANYONE...! THEN I'LL!!! BE FORCED!!! TO ASK UNDYNE FOR HELP!!!
I CHANGED MY MIND!!! THIS IS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE QUEEN HAS RETURNED... AND ALSO THAT SHE'S A HUGE DORK!!! YOU TWO ARE TWO FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER!!! WHY ARE YOU TEXTING!!!
UNDYNE WILL BE REALLY PROUD OF ME!! THE KING WILL TRIM A HEDGE IN THE SHAPE OF MY SMILE!!!
HMMM... YOU MUST BE HAVING CULTURE SHOCK. YOU SEE, WHERE I COME FROM, IT'S A LOVING TRADITION. TO SUFFER THROUGH HORRIBLE PUZZLES FOR NO REASON.
TO BE HONEST, I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID... BUT YOU'RE ALREADY BECOMING A GREAT PERSON! I'M SO PROUD I COULD CRY!!!
PLEASE ASK BEFORE YOU ESCAPE!!! WHEN YOU WENT MISSING I GOT WORRIED SICK!!!
HE'S NAPPING HIMSELF INTO AN EARLY GRAVE!!
YES, HE MANS TWO STATIONS AT ONCE. AMAZING, ISN'T HE? HE SLACKS OFF TWICE AS MUCH AS NORMAL!!
BUT I'M ALSO AN ESTEEMED ARCHITECT!!! MY BROTHER HELPED ME FIND THE BOX!
HMM? HE NEVER TOLD YOU?? YEAH, SANS NEVER TELLS ANYBODY ANYTHING!
IT'S A GOOD THING I SPOTTED YOU FIRST! I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A WEIRD FIRST IMPRESSION.
STOP CALLING AND MAKING HER SAY GROSS THINGS.
(PSST, WHEN WAS SHE MAD AT ME?)
HOWDY! IF IT ISN'T MY GOOD FRIEND, WHO TRUSTS ME.
WOW! BEING A GOOD HOST IS A REAL WORKOUT!
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS... THAT MUST MEAN I'M BEING A GREAT HOST!!!
SO YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH A GHOST... ISN'T THAT KIND OF SPOOKY? I'D THINK YOU'D LIKE YOUR FRIENDS WARM AND CUDDLY... LIKE SKELETONS!!! VERY SOFT, AND FULL OF CALCIUM.
THESE SNAILS ARE JUST LIKE MY BROTHER. ROUND, SLOW... AND CONSTANTLY EMITTING SLIME??? EMITTING SLIME... THAT'S JUST WHAT BROTHERS DO.
LANTERNS? UM, OKAY... CAN YOU EAT THEM??? I'M SERIOUSLY OUT OF IDEAS HERE.
ANIME? ISN'T THAT A KIND OF CARTOON FOR SMALL CHILDREN?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FRIENDS, UNDYNE. YOU ENRICH MY LIFE WITH SHED-BASED PUNS.
LASERS ON CONVEYORS? NO THANKS. SOUNDS LIKE MY LEAST FAVORITE NIGHTMARE. DON'T TELL ME MORE OF THIS GARBAGE.
HOW LUCKY OF YOU! HAD I ONLY USED MY SPECIAL ATTACK, YOU SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN BLASTED TO... HEY. WAIT. WHERE'S MY SPECIAL ATTACK?
#undyne
BUT NOW??? I DON'T CARE! I'M NOT YOUR FREAKING KINDERGARTEN TEACHER!
I'll make you like me so much... Your WHOLE LIFE will revolve around me!! 
You're gonna have to try a little harder than THAT.
I don't actually want to hurt you either. At first, I hated your stupid saccharine schtick, but... The way you hit me right now, it... Reminded me of someone I used to train with.
I've READ Alphys's human history book collection! I know all about your giant swords... Your colossal, alien-fighting robots... Your supernatural princesses...
That's where I first talked to you! Weren't you SUPER terrified? I practice that monologue ALL the time in the mirror!
Going off-the-cuff... It helped that I... Uh. Completely forgot the words to my monologue, anyway...
Why would I EVER be friends with YOU!? If you weren't my houseguest, I'd beat you up right now!
What I like about you is that you're PASSIONATE! You're ANALYTICAL!! It doesn't matter what it is! YOU CARE ABOUT IT!!
Alphys... I want to help you become happy with who you are!
Deep, deep in my soul. There's a burning feeling I can't describe. A burning feeling that WON'T let me die.
Alphys told me that she would watch me fight you... And if anything went wrong, she would... evacuate everyone.
Ugh, ice cream!? Sugary... COLD... Talk about GROSS. Now this chilly pink stuff that Alphys makes me...
Alphys helped measure out the mud tiles for this puzzle. It was a lot of work, but we got to make sand castles after.
But, um, to be honest... ...I don't know if I can ever let Papyrus into the Royal Guard. Don't tell him I said that! He's just... well... I mean it's not that he's weak. He's actually pretty freaking tough! It's just that... he's... he's too innocent and nice!!! I mean, look, he was SUPPOSED to capture you... and he ended up being friends with you instead! I could NEVER send him to battle! He'd get ripped into little smiling shreds.
Papyrus, wait, you know I'm joking, right...?
You know what would be more valuable to everyone? IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!
The whole time I was chasing after you... I felt something... Strange. The echoes of something warm, something... Something like 'I miss being friends with you.
Y'know, I was a pretty hotheaded kid. Once, to prove I was the strongest, I tried to fight ASGORE. Emphasis on TRIED. I couldn't land a single blow on him!
Hey ASGORE, is that your ex? Jeez. That's rough, buddy.
Be nice to them, okay!? Cherish this ghost!!!
All he did was lie seductively on the piano... And fed himself grapes. I don't really like that guy. But I admire his lifestyle.
Oh yeah, Shyren lives around here. I used to give her piano lessons.
#alphys
Hey, why didn't you tell me the queen was so cute?
UNDYNE!!! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER!!! I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU!!! HOLD ME, UNDYNE!! HOLD ME!!!
the families keep calling me to ask when everyone is coming home. what am i supposed to say? i don't even answer the phone anymore.
i spend all my time at the garbage dump now it's my element
Actually, since you stepped out of the RUINS, I've, um... ...been "observing" your journey through my console. Your fights... Your friendships... Everything! I was originally going to stop you, but... Watching someone on a screen really makes you root for them.
S-so, ahhh, now I want to help you! Using my knowledge, I can easily guide you through Hotland! I know a way right to ASGORE's castle, no problem!
Anti... anti-human combat features? Of c-course, when I saw you coming, I immediately decided... I have to remove those features! Unfortunately, I may have made a teensy mistake while doing so. And, um... Now he's an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for human blood?
OH! OH! I KNOW THIS ONE!!! IT'S SNAIL ICE CREAM!!!!!!!! IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER EVERYONE GOES TO THE BEACH!!! AND SHE BUYS ICE CREAM FOR ALL OF HER FRIENDS!!!! BUT IT'S SNAIL FLAVOR AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS IT!!!!!!
It can do texting, items, it's got a key chain... I even signed you up for the underground's No. 1 social network! Now we're officially friends! Ehehehe!
This p-puzzle is kinda... um... timing- based. Y-you see those switches over there? Y-you'll have to press all three of them within 3 seconds. I'll t-try to help you with the rhythm!
I don't really... Like giving away puzzle solutions. But if you need help, just call me, ok?
Actually, wait, I have an idea! Let's be friends on UnderNet! Then you can just ping me when you need help! Wait, we're already friends, aren't we? I signed you up, didn't I? You've been reading my posts the whole time... Well! I hope! You agree with me! About Mew Mew 2!
F-f-fortunately, I might have a plan! When I was upgrading your phone, I added a few... features. You see that huge button that says... "JETPACK"?
N-no...! I must not have added enough fuel! D-darnit... I'm sorry... Even when it's something like this, I... I still...! I still...
Wow! We... we did it!! We... we really did it!!! Great job out there, team!
Why didn't you head to the right...? C-C'mon... Y-you trust me, d-don't you?
But, you know how Mettaton always faces f-f-forward? That's because there's a switch on his backside. S-s-so if y-y-you c-c-can turn him around... um... And, umm... press th-th-th-the switch... He'll be... um... He'll be... Vulnerable.
...thank GOD, it's just the batteries.
H... hey... D... don't worry about it... I can always... I can always build a different robot!
W... Wait! I mean, um... I... I was just going to... ...um... Say goodbye, and... I can't take this anymore. I... I lied to you.
If you want to go home... You'll have to take his soul. You'll have to kill ASGORE.
Oh my god. Oh no. That's adorable... And I h-had no idea you, um, wrote that way!
R... roleplay? ...That actually sounds kind of fun!
I... I just wanted to impress you! I just wanted you to think I was smart and cool.
This isn't anyone else's problem but mine. But if you don't ever hear from me again... If you want to know 'the truth.' Enter the door to the north of this note. You all at least deserve to know what I did.
Every day I'm scared... Scared what will happen if people learn the truth on their own. They'll all get hurt because of me..
Sorry about that... They get kind of sassy when they don't get fed on time.
Now, I've changed my mind about all this. I'm going to tell everyone what I've done. It's going to be hard. Being honest... Believing in myself...
Uh, h-h-hi! (THERE'S TWO OF THEM???)
Y-yeah, ASGORE!! Undyne's totally right about that fish thing! S-sometimes you've just got to, uh... S-stop going after furry boss monsters and, uh... J-just get to know a really cute fish...?
Papyrus... YOU called everyone here, right? Well, besides, uh, her. Uh, anyway... If I got here before you... How did you know how to call everybody?
Technically, it's impossible for you to beat him... B-but... Somehow, I know you can do it!!
No, I should be honest!! I'm gonna stay inside and watch anime like a total loser!
(Oh My God?) (Frisk. Please.) (Help me explain what anime is to Asgore.)
But when Undyne called, with crazed desperation in her voice... I... I realized I had to do something. Even if it meant everybody would... Have to learn the truth about me. It's strange. You know? Even after all the bad things I did. People treated me like a hero.
now that mettaton's made it big, he never talks to me anymore. ...except to ask when i'm going to finish his body. but i'm afraid if i finish his body, he won't need me anymore... then we'll never be friends ever again.
I just wanted you to think I was smart and cool. That I wasn't some... nerdy loser.
I'm sorry. I j-just figured, y-you know... It'd be f-fun to go on like, a cute, kind of... Pretend date with you? T-to make you feel better? Well, it sounds even worse when I put it like that.
You know. Just daydreaming here. But... I really should have killed you when I had the chance.
Just think about how cute they must have been together. It's quickly becoming my number one ship of all time. Tori and Gorey...
Ehehe... Ehehehe... AHA! AHAHAH! HA!! HA!!! Oh, Toriel. You have NO idea.
A woman can dream though, right? And write fanfiction. A LOT of fanfiction.
#asgore
Human... I promise you... For as long as you remain here... My wife and I will take care of you as best we can.
I do not want power. I do not want to hurt anyone.
This war has gone on long enough. You have the power... Take my soul, and leave this cursed place.
I just wanted everyone to have hope...
I just want to see my wife. I just want to see my child.
#chara
No chocolate.
SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?
You want to go back to the world you destroyed.
It was you who pushed everything to its edge.
It was you who led the world to its destruction.
But you cannot accept it.
You think you are above consequences.
We can reach a compromise.
This SOUL resonates with a strange feeling.
There is a reason you continue to recreate this world.
There is a reason you continue to destroy it.
